                    Yes for sure, here is an example that I find mind-blowing where she assembled used facial mask to create a long dress in order to protest against single use plastics and how it can make marin life worse. She also includes two dogs in the picture to raise awarness on the impact of dogs on the environment and the rise of puppy farms.

                    Your suggestion is good, it can be interresting to see a stylist in this nomination but she could not win aginst the talent of Benjamin Von Wong. If you have already seen his art you understand why I say that. He makes beautifuls installations with on one hand a part of nature and on the other hand a part of waste which is completing the nature beautifully. He confronts both of them in order to take beautifuls photography.

                    I think Max Liboiron is an ideal opponent to these persons, she has a background in environmental sciences which makes her an expert on the question and she uses waste collected from the Hudson river and surrounding New York areas to make snow globes which I find to be an interesting object. It create a kind of small biome that allow spectators to understand better what's happening down there in the oceans.

                    If we need to present artists that make a splash, I'm going to chose Lorenzo Quinn and more specifically is art installation called Support that he made in 2017. It's a very striking installation since it is litterally exposed in the Grand Canal of Venise. We can see two gigantic hands allegedly belonging to a child which are holding back the facade of the hotel Ca’ Sagredo, it alert peoples about the risks of the global warming and therefore the rising of the sea level as well as the mass tourism and paquebots which puts the city in danger by weakening its fundations.

                    If it's originality that matter for you, I think that Max Liboiron has had a good idea with her snowball. But personally i really apreciated John's proposition, i find that it's even more shocking for peoples when we try to imagine the rest of the child under the water. It overall something that a really big amount of peoples and to change the mentality of the most numerous is exactly what i'm looking for.
