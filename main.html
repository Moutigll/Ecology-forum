            We were about to wait&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

        MrWilliam:

            Sorry, I think that I found the perfect artist for the eco-artist of the year nomination. I think that he is bringing a new wave of ecological prevention.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

        MrSmith:
        <div class="content">
            Ok, we are ready to hear about him, who is he and what make him so special ?&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>

        MrWilliam:
        <div class="content">
            It's a singer who is called Lomepal. He made various songs where he included ecological subjects, like the one 50 degrees wich talk about the global warming.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
        MrJohn:
        <div class="content">
            Yeah why not, it's a good idea to include a musical artist in the nomination, especially with the popularisation of streaming platforms.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>

    <div class="textbox">
        MrJohnson:
        <div class="content">
            Actually i don't think we can sanely add it to the list knowing that he is accused of sexual assault.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="textbox">
        MrSmith:
        <div class="content">
            I agree ! It's unacceptable to even have the thought of including a rapist&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>

        MrWilliam:

            Oh sorry, I hadn't learn about this detail&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>

        MrSmith:
        <div class="content">
            What ? How can you refer to this as a detail ? It's disgusting !&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
        </div>

        MrJohnson:

            Calm down please gentlemans, it's a serious meeting here.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

        MrJohnson:

            So, I have an other artist which deserve recognition, she is named Marina Debris, she is well-known for her work in the fashion industry, she made numerous clothes assembled with pieces of trash.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

            Ok, if nobody sees a problem, I'm good with this.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

        MrJohn:
        <div class="content">
            It's fine MrJohnson, thanks for your submission, I keep her name in a corner of my head.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

        MrSmith:

            Your suggestion is good, it can be interresting to see a stylist in this nomination but she could not win aginst the talent of Benjamin Von Wong. If you have already seen his art you understand why I say that. He makes beautifuls installations with a part of nature and a part of waste which is completing the nature beautifully. He confronts the nature and the pollution that he see to take beautifuls photography. &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
